# micjammer

The Mic Jammer is an ultrasonic security system that gives people the
confidence to know that their smart phone microphones are non-invasively muted.
It blasts a ton of ultrasonic noise at a iPhone mems microphone that is
above the range of human hearing but still within the sensitive range of the mic.
This is s version of the schematic I used to build an ultrasonic mic jammer at EYEBEAM.
